-- TODO --
react native toast package

- Make button as class/dynamic

+ Calendar input

+ Phone number format - country and spacing
npm i react-native-phone-number-input --save

FIRST NAME LAST NAME VS FULL NAME
https://blog.prototypr.io/full-name-vs-first-last-name-ux-best-practice-8c2db7178fd1



--- BUGS ---
+ StyledButton not spelled correcly
+ Capcha spelt incorrectly
+ confirm password spelt incorrectly on OrgSignUp.js

--- NOTES ---
Storage of sessions should be with react-native-keychain, not asyncStorage.
For encryption purpose

-- QUESTIONS --
+ Do we lookup username and email, or just email? for staff signin

One case we need DOB from the staff, or user => If a user orders maybe alcohol, then
the staff need to have info on their DOB. If a nurse user wants a certain medication
staff might need DOB to get the right dosage or stuff like that.

+ Will redis session terminate after the app is closed? We dont want that because
user should be able open the app and re-signin.
